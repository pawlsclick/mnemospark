# mnemospark

mnemospark is an OpenClaw plugin that provides access to hyper-scaler cloud operations and proprietary data sets. Payments via x402 USDC on Base.

## Quick start

1. **Install the plugin in OpenClaw** (required):

   ```bash
   openclaw plugins install mnemospark
   openclaw gateway start
   ```

2. **Optional — wallet setup** (creates or reuses a Base wallet; does not register the plugin):

   ```bash
   npx mnemospark install --standard
   ```

Plugin registration is handled only by `openclaw plugins install mnemospark`. The `npx mnemospark install` command sets up your wallet and helper scripts under `~/.openclaw/mnemospark/`; it does not write to `~/.openclaw/extensions/`.

In OpenClaw: `/mnemospark wallet`, `/mnemospark cloud help`. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/pawlsclick/mnemospark#readme) and [OpenClaw plugins docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/plugin) if the plugin is not found.
